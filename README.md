# BingeWatch

## Overview
BingeWatch is a mobile application designed for movie enthusiasts who want to discover, track, and organize their favorite films. With a clean and intuitive interface, users can browse trending movies, search for specific titles, and save films to their personalized watchlist. The app ensures that users never lose track of a great movie again.

### **How to Use the App:**
- **Explore Movies:** Browse trending and recommended films on the home screen.
- **Search:** Find movies by title, genre, or release year.
- **Movie Details:** View cast, synopsis, trailers, and ratings.
- **Watchlist:** Save movies to watch later and access them anytime.

### **Purpose of the App:**
This project is an opportunity to deepen my expertise in mobile development using React Native. It allows me to work with APIs, manage local storage, and create a responsive and engaging UI. By integrating third-party data sources, I am also learning how to handle real-time content and optimize app performance.
